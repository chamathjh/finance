## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical applications in the world of finance. Throughout my master studies, I have gained a deep understanding of financial theory and its mathematical foundations. However, I believe that true value is created when theory is put into practice.

In this repository, I provide practical implementations of financial models that cover various areas such as asset pricing, portfolio management, risk assessment, option pricing, and more. Each model is accompanied by detailed documentation, code explanations, and examples to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Models
Here are some of the financial models available in this repository:

* Monte Carlo Simulations: Perform simulations to estimate the range of possible outcomes and assess risks in portfolio value.

* Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization: Construct efficient portfolios by optimizing the trade-off between risk and return using mean and covariance matrices.

These are just a few examples of the financial models available in this repository. The collection will continue to expand as I explore and implement additional models and techniques.

## Usage
To use the models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the specific model directory of interest.

3. Read the documentation and code explanation provided within each model's directory to understand its underlying theory and assumptions.

4. Execute the code in your preferred programming environment, following the provided examples and guidelines.

Feel free to customize and adapt the models according to your specific needs and datasets. However, please note that these models are provided for educational and informational purposes only. Use them responsibly and conduct your own due diligence.
